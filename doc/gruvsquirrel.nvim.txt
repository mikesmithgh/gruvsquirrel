ACKOWLEDGEMENTS          *gruvsquirrel.nvim-gruvsquirrel.nvim-ackowledgements*

- gruvbox <https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox>
    > Designed as a bright theme with pastel 'retro groove' colors and light/dark mode switching in the way of solarized. The main focus when developing gruvbox is to keep colors easily distinguishable, contrast enough and still pleasant for the eyes.
- gruvbox.nvim <https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim>
    > A port of gruvbox community theme to lua with treesitter support!
- tokyonight.nvim <https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim>
    > A dark and light Neovim theme written in Lua ported from the Visual Studio Code TokyoNight theme. Includes extra themes for Kitty, Alacritty, iTerm and Fish.
- fzf-lua <https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua>
    > This is my take on the original fzf.vim, written in lua for neovim 0.5, it builds on the elegant nvim-fzf as an async interface to create a performant and lightweight fzf client for neovim that rivals any of the new shiny fuzzy finders for neovim.
- gruvbox-material <https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material>
    > Gruvbox Material is a modified version of Gruvbox, the contrast is adjusted to be softer in order to protect developersâ€™ eyes.
- vim-gruvbox8 <https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-gruvbox8>
    > This is a simplified and optimized version of Gruvbox that I have developed to address some issues I had with the official color scheme.
- gruvbox-flat.nvim <https://github.com/eddyekofo94/gruvbox-flat.nvim>
    > A dark beautiful Neovim theme written in Lua.
- rose-pine/neovim <https://github.com/rose-pine/neovim>
    > All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist
- vim-colorizer.lua <https://github.com/norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua>
    > A high-performance color highlighter for Neovim which has no external dependencies! Written in performant Luajit.
- colortils.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-colortils/colortils.nvim>
    > Neovim color utils
- vim-colortemplate <https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate>
    > Colortemplate is a 100% VimScript plugin for Vim 8 or later, which makes it easy to develop color schemes. Its ambitious goal is to become the way to create new color schemes for Vim!
